I am a PhD candidate at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), where I work with Professor [David Simchi-Levi](http://slevi1.mit.edu/) on problems in dynamic pricing and revenue management.  My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and operations management, and involves applying statistical learning techniques to pricing and inventory management problems in online retail, particularly fashion retail.

Before MIT I worked for a year as a research assistant at the Institute for Infocomm Research in Singapore, and before that, I received my BA in Applied Mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley.

My undergraduate and graduate studies have been generously funded until September 2018 by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore.
