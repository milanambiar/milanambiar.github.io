I am a PhD candidate at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/), where I work with Professor [David Simchi-Levi](http://slevi1.mit.edu/) on problems in dynamic pricing and revenue management.  My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and operations management, and involves applying statistical learning techniques to pricing and inventory management problems in online retail, particularly fashion retail.
Before MIT I worked for a year with Dr Yu Rongshan at the Institute for Infocomm Research in Singapore on pricing problems in smart grids, and before that, I received my BA in Applied Mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley.
